Hi! My name is Jun Taek, and I'm a third year undergraduate student majoring in
Mathematics and Psychology at Grinnell College. I am an aspiring data scientist
interested in using data science for social good and to create tools that make our daily lives more productive.

I first came across data science upon a friend's suggestion to take Andrew Ng's
Machine Learning course on Coursera, and I was hooked: learning about the
algorithms I had been taking for granted for years and their broad applications
was astonishing. Since then, I have been working on lots of independent
projects (check out my projects page), and I think it's safe to say that this time, this interest is here to stay.

Anyways, I created this website because I found that so many students at Grinnell
College want to learn about DS but there are few resources on campus. I started
a DS club to teach the basics of machine learning, so everything I talk about
will be up on the ML101 page here.

I figured that while I help my peers, I might as well help myself and publicize
some of my work. Feel free to check out my other tabs to see what I have
been up to.

If you like what I do, please feel free to contact me at:

Special thanks to:
* Linh Pham for helping me with Jekyll
* Professor Kuiper for encouraging me to start this
* `codeasashu` for the template for this website
