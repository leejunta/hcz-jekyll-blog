# Mini-hackathon

This week, most of our members were supposed to go to the hackathon at ISU
(HackISU), but due to severe weather conditions, none of the drivers felt
comfortable driving us there. Instead, some of the organizers decided that they
will host a 8 hour long hackathon on campus instead!

The hackathon will start at 12pm and they will provide dinner and snacks
throughout. If you're interested, please contact Jarren Santos at [santosja17].

See you all there!

# Up next...

Join us again next week to learn about how to implement a logistic regression
model with regularization!
